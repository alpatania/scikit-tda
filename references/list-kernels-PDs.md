# List of references on kernels for PDs

## Early development

### Moo K. Chung - 2009,2011 - 
*has many articles about building kernels from PDs but they are build adhoc for the task and little information about their relation to Wesserstein or bottleneck distances*. i would put this on low priority for now

### Heat Kernel Signature based on persistence landscapes

## Full TDA ML integration

### Li, Ovsjanikov, Chazal - 2014 - Persistence based structural recognition


### Reininghaus, Huber, Bauer, Kwitt - 2014 - A stable Multi-Scale Kernel 
Things to remember:
	- features that never die/essential features are ignored.
	- each point in a PD is seens as a Dirac delta function and a PD as sum of Dirac deltas
	- PD is then an initial condition of a heat diffusion problem with a Dirichlet boundary condition on the diagonal
	- The kernel is 1-Wesserstain stable
